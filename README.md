#What is a WA dashboard?
The water accounting dashboard provides detailed multi-year water accounts of a basinâ€™s water 
resources including inflows, outflows, water use patterns and availability, to establish baseline 
conditions. It can also compare baseline and future water accounts (where available), to provide 
stakeholders with an understanding of the current and potential future water resources status. 
The platform leverages advanced data visualization tools to offer user-friendly access to complex 
information, empowering stakeholders to understand the dynamics between various water-balance 
parameters. In addition, the dashboard was designed to ensure that it caters to stakeholders of 
diverse backgrounds and expertise, from policymakers to scientists. Stakeholder feedback was 
incorporated to enrich the platform's accessibility and user experience to enable active participation 
and engagement.
This web-based dashboard represents one of the tools that could be used in promoting effective 
stakeholder deliberation of water balance information for sustainable water resource management.
